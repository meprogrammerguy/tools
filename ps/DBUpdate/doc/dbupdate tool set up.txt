New dbupdate settings:

1. install SQL server 2014 together with all tools
2. install TFS Powershell 2012 or later
3. After SQL server is updated we need to put "Import-Module SqlPs" in the script
4. Change DBUpdate.xml to point to 3.x region. We should make this step esier so user doesn't have to manually set it up.
5. based on DBUpdate.xml to create all local folders and put the EXE file(LoadUCDATA.exe) in the correct place
   we can make this step easier by creating the same directory and folders for all users automatically

6. copy all new messages(including edc and edx messages), forms, services, and signations under C:\DBUpdate\resources directory to DV region after the database update process is completed successfully

7. In TFS change the UAR directory from H:\UNICOMP\CSCE\CSPV6\CS08_3_12\USYS to C:messages/3_12 (this is the directory I used)

8. the IDF.asn in the local directory (C:\DbUpdate\MessagesGenerated_v3) need to be modified to point to the local resources folder
   Such as C:\DBUpdate\MessagesGenerated_v3\resources under resources section and
   $resources_output=c:\DBUpdate\MessagesGenerated_v3\resources under setting section
9. Run the batch file GenerateUAR.bat to create UAR file
   The new messages are created in c:\DBUpdate\MessagesGenerated_v3\resources and the new UAR file is created at C:messages (you may use differetn directory)
   check in the UAR
